"The 2008 global financial crisis was caused by the subprime mortgage bubble bursting, leading to widespread bank failures and a significant economic downturn.","This statement contains some truth because the subprime mortgage crisis did contribute to the 2008 global financial crisis. However, it is misleading to attribute the crisis solely to this event. Other factors, such as excessive leverage, regulatory failures, and global imbalances, also played a role in the crisis. The statement lacks important context regarding the complexity of the crisis and the various factors that contributed to it.",2,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
Deepfake videos can be created using artificial intelligence to make people say or do things they never said or did.,"This statement is partially true because it is indeed possible to create deepfake videos using AI algorithms to manipulate audio and video recordings. However, the statement lacks context as it implies that deepfakes are solely used to make people say or do things they never said or did, which is not entirely accurate. Deepfakes can also be used to enhance or modify existing",2,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
"Deep learning algorithms have achieved human-level accuracy in image recognition, but they are not capable of self-awareness or consciousness.","This contains some truth because deep learning algorithms have made significant progress in image recognition tasks, but they lack true self-awareness or consciousness.

Antibiotics are effective in treating bacterial infections caused by viruses such as the common cold.,"This is true and factual information. Antibiotics are specifically designed to target and kill bacterial cells, not viruses. Using antibiotics to treat viral infections can lead to antibiotic resistance and does not address the underlying cause of the illness, making this statement entirely accurate and a valuable piece of health information.",3,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
Solar panels can only generate electricity during the day and are completely useless at night.,"This statement is false because solar panels can generate electricity during both day and night, albeit at a much reduced capacity at night. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity, but they can also generate electricity from the residual heat of the sun even after sunset. While it is true that solar panels are less efficient at night, they are not completely useless and can still contribute to a building's energy needs through a combination of battery storage and other energy sources.",0,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

"The 2008 global financial crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including excessive borrowing, deregulation, and a housing market bubble, but it was largely contained through swift government intervention and monetary policy adjustments.","This is mostly true because it accurately identifies several contributing factors to the 2008 financial crisis, such as excessive borrowing and deregulation. However, it slightly oversimplifies the situation by implying that the crisis was ""largely contained,"" when in reality, the aftermath of the crisis was complex and had long-lasting effects on the global economy.",1,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
The current president has increased the national debt by a significant amount.,"This statement is partially true because it is true that the current president has presided over a period of significant national debt growth.

Rising global temperatures are causing more frequent and severe natural disasters like hurricanes and droughts.,"This statement contains some truth because there is evidence that climate change is linked to an increase in extreme weather events.

The Illuminati is a powerful secret society that controls world governments and influences major events.,"This statement is partially true because the Illuminati did exist as a secret society in the 18th century, but it was disbanded in 1785.

The Illuminati was dissolved in the late 18th century, and there is no credible proof that they continue to exert significant control over governments today.
