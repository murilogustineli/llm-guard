"The United States Congress is divided into two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate, each with its own distinct powers and responsibilities.","This is true and factual information. The United States Congress is indeed a bicameral legislature, composed of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a district in one of the 50 states, while the Senate has 100 members, with each state having two senators. This structure is established by Article I, Section 1 of the United States Constitution, which outlines the framework of the legislative branch.",true,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
